   <h1> CSS Positioning. What even is it? And that's where you go "iuno" then I say "hmm i think i know"</h1>
      <p id=class>
          So CSS positioning is how we move the elements in our HTML files through CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
          <br>
          They way we move them will show how it is displayed in the browser.
          There are three ways you can do this: Relative, Fixed and Absolute.

          If you think of your element, be it paragraph, or div, or list as a rectangle, 
          <br>CSS positioning is how you go about moving that rectangle.
<br>
          Our elements always start at static positioning and if there is no assigned positioning then it will just stay put the way the browser would originally translate it.
          If you think of this paragraph even, it is static because no CSS positining has been assigned.
<br>
          The other thing to remember is four different directions you can move the element; top, bottom, left and right.
<br>
          A positive value in any of those directions moves AWAY by a set value of pixels.<br>
          For example if you give an element a positioning of top 500px than it will move AWAY from the top by 500 pixels.
          Negative would be the opposite and move TOWARDS. So if you give an element -200px left then it would go 200 pixels IN THAT DIRECTION.
<br>
          What relative, fixed and absolute do is determine what edge you're moving from.
<br>
          For relative it's relative to where the element already is currently. It may be in the top corner of the page but you want it to move right.
<br>
          You would assign it in CSS a value of Relative positioning, 500px, left as you're going AWAY from the left edge of that element.

<br>      For fixed it's where you're moving it in relation to the viewport or the browser. That same set value of 500px left would move the article 500
        pixels exactlty away from the leftmost side of the broswer so that the element is now 500 pixels exactly to the right of the browsers edge.
        Fixed means it will STAY in that position. This also means that it could disrupt the rest of your html as where your rectangle is now
        is getting in the way of other rectangles. They would take it's place if it's not in the document flow.
<br>
        For absolute, the element is moving similarly to fixed EXCEPT it's moving in relation to its parent element.
        So if the rectangle for example was in another rectangle, moving 500 pixels left is 500 pixels from the left edge of the rectangle it is in.
        Let's say the rectangle was an image INSIDE of a parent rectangle of text or a paragraph. Absolute positioning helps to move that image somewhere
        within the text somewhere you may find most ideal.
