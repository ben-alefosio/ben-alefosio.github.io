    <h1>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE BLOG</h1>

    <div id ="box"><p>
If you can remember a situation where you spoke out of turn and someone replied with "Read the room", 
<br>then you have a good starting point for understanding what Emotional Intelligence is.
<br><br> You might not have known any better that your doctor, doctor joke 
<br> wasn't appropriate at the funeral reception, or that bringing up a story of your ex 
<br> on the first date may have been an overshare, but where those miscues regularly occur, 
<br> Emotional Intelligence helps to inform your handle on these situations.
<br><br> As I personally understand it, EQ (Emotional Quotient/Emotional Intelligence) is the ability to put your emotions 
<br> and the emotions of others 
into perspective, and figure out the best way to deal with them.
<br>Different social settings and people require a different approach, and the better you are at knowing an appropriate response 
<br>to a given situation shows where your level of EQ is.
<br><br>As an example, if you were a boss with an employee who was really good at his job but was lowering the morale of other workmates through snide remarks,
<br>the usual response would of course be to pull him aside and let him know that how he's behaving isn't acceptable. 
<br> Through EQ though, you would also acknowledge why he's acting out in this way, what you as an employer can do to help him overcome this issue, and as you're doing this,
<br>have a good read of his/your own/your team's feelings about the situation. You don't want to chide him as that may be met with aggressiveness, 
<br>but you also want to stress why it's important he changes his attitude as you don't want to minimize the problem.
<br> Essentially you want to find a balance where you can understand his point of view, but still reduce the toxicity of the work environment.
<br>
<br> This sort of reading and analyzing in EQ is a learned skill, but may come more naturally to others.
<br> A person who was raised to consider what other people are going through might find it easier to empathize
<br> than someone who was taught to fend for themselves and put their needs first. This means that you
<br> need to build an awareness of your emotions and how they may trigger the actions of others.
<br> You may sense that talking to someone in a direct, matter-of-fact manner is all they need to perform
<br> exceptionally well, but for another person, they need to be carefully spoken to and shown more encouragement
<br> so that they can provide similar results. This is why studies show that Emotional Intelligence plays
<br> a big role in workplace leadership; you're acknowledging people and their unique set of emotional responses,
<br> as opposed to giving standard affirmations that don't tackle a root cause.
