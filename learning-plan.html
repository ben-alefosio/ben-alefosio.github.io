        <H1> LEARNING PLAN </H1>
        <p> Long term goal and/or career pathway: Unsure just yet <br>
        
        Description of own strngth and limitation in relation to learning: I'm finding out very fast how much<br>
    it's hard to juggle working with learning so I can't multi-task for shit<br>
however I have a stickability that was nowhere to be found earlier on <br><br>

What skills would you like to see developed in yourself at EDA?: ORGANIZATION AND PREPARATION. AS BRUCE LEE ONCE SAID,
I NEED TO HACK AWAY AT THE UNESSENTIAL BECAUSE I GET CAUGHT UP<br>
IN UNIMPORTANT DETAILS SO LOSE TIME AS A RESULT.<br>
I WANT TO LEARN TO MAKE GAMES TOO<br><br>

How will you manage your workload?: <br>
I'll need to cut my hours at work in all honestly.<br>
I'll need to reach out earlier to EDA too<br><br>

What I expect from facilitation team?:<br>
nothing that I haven't already gotten tbh<br><br>

Scheduling information:<br>
As I said I need to start to work around study and not the other way around<br>
so I'll need to switch the focus up from my full-time job<br>
