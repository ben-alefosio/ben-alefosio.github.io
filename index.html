        <p> Hi there! My name is Ben Alefosio, and this is my first ever webpage.
           <br> I'm currently doing
           Foundations, a prep course through Enspiral Dev Academy
           that runs for 5 weeks. 
           <br> This is to ready it's students
           for a gruelling 3 month DEV bootcamp running from January to
           March next year. 
           <br> In this webpage you'll be able to see my blog
           entries related to work being done in Foundations 
           <br> as well as other
           stuff that I find cool and relative to me. Feel free to have a geez. Have a good day!
