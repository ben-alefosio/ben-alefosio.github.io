        <h1> IDENTIY VALUES </h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
                Some of my core personal values include: </strong>
            <br><strong>accountability, respect, authenticity, family, and appreciation.</strong> 
            <br><br> <strong>Accountability</strong> – Being able to hold up your end. Having the team’s trust because they know you’ll follow through.
            <br><br> <strong>Respect</strong> – Showing care to others and behaving in a manner that doesn’t tear people 
            <br>down but looks out for their well-being. It’s especially key to have self-respect 
            <br>because then it informs how you’ll act in other environments – constant self-checking.

            <br><br> <strong>Authenticity</strong> -  I believe in being genuine and truthful and speaking what’s on your mind, 
            <br>not what will get you approval. In a world where you can present yourself as anything for clicks and clout, 
            <br> it’s the people who are just being themselves that can connect to people the easiest.

            <br><br> <strong>Family</strong> – Family is everything to me, even when I get carried away and forget to 
            <br>think how what I’m doing best serves them. It always comes back to them because 
            <br>it’s what I started with and is what’s gotten me to this point.

            <br><br> <strong>Appreciation</strong> – Knowing I’m doing well is always great but expressing to others that 
            <br>I’m thankful for whatever they do is so crucial. There are so many thankless jobs out there and I know 
            <br> it’s a little big thing I can do, acknowledging the role people play in my life.
            
            <br><br><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up 
                <br>the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</strong>
            <br><br> I think a key one for me growing up was deciding to stop hanging out with the company I kept 
            <br> because I knew it was leading me down a bad path. We would get up to a lot of delinquent activity 
            <br> and then it came to a point where my sister talked me through how the rest of my teen years could play out 
            <br> if I kept acting out with this group. I thought a lot about sacrifices made in my family and how much of a 
            <br> slap in their face it’d be to still get into trouble and so I just stopped hanging out with these guys. 
            <br> The consequences were nothing but positive because then I started to focus more on school and I learned 
            <br> the importance of having good friends around you.
             
            
            <br><br><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>
            <br><br>My family always stressed it’s important to know what you’re doing with your life 
            <br>and how you’re going to accomplish it – not just daydreaming it into existence. 
            <br>My grandparents never wanted me to go into anything I wasn’t sure I was going to put 
            <br> 100% effort in, so at points in the last five or so years where I thought I’d go back 
            <br> to study, I knew I had to rein in that instinct because in the back of my mind I felt 
            <br> I wasn’t ready. As a Samoan, there’s a lot of importance in working and being able to 
            <br> support your family so my identity now is based a lot around being a provider. I want to 
            <br> properly set up for the future family I’ll have and find a way to pay back my loved ones who raised me. 
            <br><br><strong>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</strong>
            <br><br>I’m always one to try and resolve conflicts and find common ground with the people I work alongside. 
            <br> I also am approachable and can see the best in everyone – I’ll try and help them realize their potential 
            <br> if they struggle to themselves. I’m adaptable to situations and am always ready to redirect my efforts to 
            <br> whatever else needs doing - not good at multitasking, however. I would say my main strength is responsibility 
            <br> because I feel a need to do what I say I’m going to do, and it eats at me if I don’t follow through 
            <br> because it creates a disconnect with the people who relied on me.
            <br><br>My limitations are that I’m not well-organized, even as I’m trying to journal thoughts 
            <br> and ideas in this foundation course, I can see that they’ve muddled very easily despite my 
            <br> best efforts to be clear and concise. As much as I’m a team player, I’m very antisocial so not 
            <br> always eager to participate in activities unless it speaks directly to me, i.e. board gaming 
            <br> and playing basketball for fun. It also means my communication methods may lack in comparison 
            <br> to others who will engage more. I’m also easily distracted, which doesn’t bode well for someone 
            <br> who is driven by his personal responsibility to others.<br><br>
