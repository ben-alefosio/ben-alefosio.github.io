        <h1> IDENTIY VALUES </h1>
        <p>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
Some of my core personal values include accountability, respect, authenticity, family, and appreciation. 

Accountability – Being able to hold up your end. Having the team’s trust because they know you’ll follow through.

Respect – Showing care to others and behaving in a manner that doesn’t tear people down but looks out for their well-being. It’s especially key to have self-respect because then it informs how you’ll act in other environments – constant self-checking.

Authenticity -  I believe in being genuine and truthful and speaking what’s on your mind, not what will get you approval. In a world where you can present yourself as anything for clicks and clout, it’s the people who are just being themselves that can connect to people the easiest.

Family – Family is everything to me, even when I get carried away and forget to think how what I’m doing best serves them. It always comes back to them because it’s what I started with and is what’s gotten me to this point.

Appreciation – Knowing I’m doing well is always great but expressing to others that I’m thankful for whatever they do is so crucial. There are so many thankless jobs out there and I know it’s a little big thing I can do, acknowledging the role people play in my life.

Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
I think a key one for me growing up was deciding to stop hanging out with the company I kept because I knew it was leading me down a bad path. We would get up to a lot of delinquent activity and then it came to a point where my sister talked me through how the rest of my teen years could play out if I kept acting out with this group. I thought a lot about sacrifices made in my family and how much of a slap in their face it’d be to still get into trouble and so I just stopped hanging out with these guys. The consequences were nothing but positive because then I started to focus more on school and I learned the importance of having good friends around you.
Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
My family always stressed it’s important to know what you’re doing with your life and how you’re going to accomplish it – not just daydreaming it into existence. My grandparents never wanted me to go into anything I wasn’t sure I was going to put 100% effort in, so at points in the last five or so years where I thought I’d go back to study, I knew I had to rein in that instinct because in the back of my mind I felt I wasn’t ready. As a Samoan, there’s a lot of importance in working and being able to support your family so my identity now is based a lot around being a provider. I want to properly set up for the future family I’ll have and find a way to pay back my loved ones who raised me. 
Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
I’m always one to try and resolve conflicts and find common ground with the people I work alongside. I also am approachable and can see the best in everyone – I’ll try and help them realize their potential if they struggle to themselves. I’m adaptable to situations and am always ready to redirect my efforts to whatever else needs doing - not good at multitasking, however. I would say my main strength is responsibility because I feel a need to do what I say I’m going to do, and it eats at me if I don’t follow through because it creates a disconnect with the people who relied on me.

My limitations are that I’m not well-organized, even as I’m trying to journal thoughts and ideas in this foundation course, I can see that they’ve muddled very easily despite my best efforts to be clear and concise. As much as I’m a team player, I’m very antisocial so not always eager to participate in activities unless it speaks directly to me, i.e. board gaming and playing basketball for fun. It also means my communication methods may lack in comparison to others who will engage more. I’m also easily distracted, which doesn’t bode well for someone who is driven by his personal responsibility to others.
