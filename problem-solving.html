<h1> Problem Solving </h1>
<body>
    <div id=intro> 
        <p>
            Problem solving and debugging I've found are as crucial to Dev as actual code writing.
            <br> In this sprint I've learned about and used problem solving techniques that developers constantly use.
            <br> In this blog I will talk about these techniques and how I've used a couple to help me overcome breakdowns in my coding.
        </p>
    </div>
        <div id=list>

            <ul >
            <li> <strong><u>Pseudocode</u></strong> - Pseudocoding is writing out the steps in plain English before you code so that your purposefully<br>
            wrtiting with simplified instructions you give yourself. This is extremely helpful as a means to<br>
            give structure to the coding you write as you're breaking it down in layman's terms first. If you get bogged down<br>
            by the coding language you're using too, your pseudocode is the refresher to give perspective on what your required to do. </li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Rubber ducky method</u></strong> - Rubber ducky method is where you use an object, in this case a rubber ducky,<br>
            to talk about the problem you're experiencing. Developers have found that talking it out may eventuate in you figuring<br>
            out the solution as you're trying to explain the problem to a rubber ducky which is really just crystallizing<br>
            the steps you've taken, which might point to what you need to do to fix the issue. It's reminiscent of trying to tell a friend<br>
            about how you lost your wallet and retracing steps/actions then having a Eureka moment of knowing where it is. <br>
            The rubber ducky/friend is just a thing to sound off to help put together your thoughts. </li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Reading error messages</u></strong> - Reading error messages is basically what it says. When you have bugs<br>
            that come up in your code then you will receive error messages telling you what went wrong. The key with this<br>
            method is to have some basic knowledge of what exactly these messages are saying so that when you read them, you know where<br>
            to find the bugs and how to resolve them. The error may be as simple as a variable not being recognized because you've<br>
            capitalized it despite it being declared in lower case. It will usually give some sort of coordinate to which line and character<br>
            is being affected but there are also times it will be less obvious. The good thing is you'll run into errors enough<br>
            that you will naturally get better at reading them.</li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Console logging</u></strong> - Console logging is a function used to prove your code works<br>
            by printing (displaying) the output onto the console, your browser's command line interface. <br>This is a good method
            for finding out your code works as you're writing it out so you have constant reassurance.</li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Googling</u></strong> - Googling is as important in dev as it is for everyday use where you're
            stuck and need a question answered right away. <br>
            In web development you're not required to memorize everything you've learned, <br>
            and it's highly recommended that if you do get stuck that you find a solution to your problem by any means.<br>
            Your problem most likely has occured already with a solution posted online. It's important however <br>
            to find a more streamlined way of searching rather than burying yourself in tab after tab.</li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Asking peers and coaches for help</u></strong> - It is important to reach out to others for help<br>
            when you're lost because you're not going through it alone. It's also highly encouraged that you don't sit<br>
            on a problem for too long as there are time constraints in a real workplace, so being able to get that help is<br>
            a proactive method of problem solving. Communication is also huge so that when working in a team everyone knows<br>
            what the other is doing. </li>

            <br>
            <li> <strong><u>Improving your process through reflection</u></strong></em> - Whether journalling your work or<br>
            going back over your code, reflecting on what you've done and finding small ways of improvement is a great tool<br>
            to better your ability to problem solve. It may be that you found it easier to do it one way over another, or that<br>
            certain aspects are more time consuming. The point is to find ways to help yourself so that it's less draining<br>
            and more rewarding to code.</li>
            </ul>

            Over the past month of doing foundations I've used almost all of these techniques, but the ones <br>
            I've used the most would be Pseudocode, Console Logging, and Googling. 
            <br><br>
            There were times where I would be staring blank-faced at my laptop trying to figure out <br>
            what the hell I was being asked to do. Breaking it down lines in English in an <br>
            instructional way recentered the purpose of the code. <br>
            That's the huge benefit of pseudocode, it's speaking directly to me as an outsider who <br>
            who is trying to make sense of this new environment..
            <br><br>
            Console logging I've found is like a measuring tape for a carpenter, very simple but effective tool at the ready to help <br>
            you interact with your console. It's been a huge help for me to see that I'm not passing through gibberish and when <br>
            error messages do pop up it's insightful to what kinds of bugs exist in my code. 
            <br><br>
            Googling has been the essential way for me to problem solve, as well as Youtube. There's so much helpful videos and resources. <br>
            MDN Web Docs specifically is always good to refer back to when I've messed up the syntax. <br>
            <br><br><br>

        Thanks for reading through my Problem Solving blog. I hope it helps give you a clear view on ways to fix and work through bugs :)

        Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

        Got blocked on a simple problem
        Solved a problem in an elegant way.
        In both cases, explain:

        What was the problem?
        What problem solving techniques did you use?
        How did you feel throughout the process?
        What did you learn?
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes:

        Pseudocode
        Trying something
        Rubber ducky method
        Reading error messages
        Console.logging
        Googling
        Asking your peers for help
        Asking coaches for help
        Improving your process with reflection
