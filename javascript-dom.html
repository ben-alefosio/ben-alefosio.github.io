<br> Hi reader!
<br> For the past three weeks I've been learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
<br>
<br> These are three languages used in front end web developing to help
<br> the experience/presentation for users.
<br>
<br> HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is a type of markup language
<br> that helps format text so that it's able to translate through a web browser
<br> like Google Chrome or Firefox. The text that you see on a site
<br> stems from 'elements' that form the HTML, eg. a header or a paragraph.
<br> A family of these various elements collectively help to
<br> build what is essentially the body of the site.
<br>
<br> CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, I would consider the webpage's clothes.
<br> CSS is a style sheet language, a way of dressing up the text so that
<br> when presented on the site, it looks much more presentable. Think of the
<br> banner, the side bars, the colours, the positioning of different elements
<br> like headers and paragraphs. This is all due to CSS, and a page would look
<br> quite dull and uninteresting without it.
<br>
<br> If the first two are the body and the clothes, then JavaScript is obviously
<br> the magical medallion that helps accomplish tasks for the user.
<br>
<br> JavaScript is a programming language central to the world wide web much like
<br> HTML and CSS, but it's reach far extends the other two in usability.
<br> Being able to interact with your website is thanks to JS.
<br> Instead of just having content presented, you can, for example, play a game on
<br> a website (thus you can show animations). You can zoom in, you can have a
<br> menu drop down on a fast food website, you can have a timer that rings when
<br> you want it to. If HTML and CSS are a book's words and colors and pictures
<br> then JS is a page that pops up on the book, and then some.
<br>
<br> As JS is the more complicated of the three, the way to write it up ( at least
<br> from my experience ) is also much harder. How to get it to work is through executing
<br> statements. You have that medallion but you actually have to speak some magic
<br> words into it to get it to work.
<br> Control Flow is the statement's code (magic words) put in an order
<br> that makes sense enough that it will return with a desired result. 
<br> Countless functions are in the background working so that one action
<br> taken has a domino effect on the next, and this may lead to something as simple
<br> as a prompt on a website asking whether you'd like to add more to your cart.
<br>
<br> A loop for example is a single statement that will, as the name suggests, repeat
<br> instructions over and over up to the point that you set it to stop.
<br> Consider needing to make a stew for hundreds of people but only having recipe for 10.
<br> Well through a loop, this recipe will run the recipe over 10 times to help
<br> accomodate the hungry mouths.
<br>
<br> As JavaScript is multi-faceted it can also be used to make mobile apps.
<br> If you want to create simple apps that show you weather or keep inventory
<br> of the books you have in your home, this can be set up through JS.
<br> (more to be added...)
